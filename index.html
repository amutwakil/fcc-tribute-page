            <h3>Here's a time line of Muhammad Ali's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1942</b> -- Born Cassius Clay on January 17, in Louisville, Kentucky.</li>
                <li><b>1954</b> -- Begins training as a boxer after his bicycle is stolen. Over next six years, Clay wins six Kentucky Golden Gloves championships, two national Golden Gloves titles, and two AAU (Amateur Athletic Union) crowns.</li>
                <li><b>1960</b> -- Clay wins light-heavyweight gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Rome, beating Poland's Zbigniew Pietrzykowski in a 5-0 decision. In October, he wins his first professional bout, against Tunney Hunsaker.</li>
                <li><b>1964</b> -- On February 25, Clay goes up against favored Sonny Liston. In what will become his trademark, Clay begins taunting Liston, calling him an "ugly old bear," promising to "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." Clay is credited with a knockout and becomes the heavyweight champion of the world after Liston fails to come out of his corner for the seventh round. Clay coins the phrase "I am the greatest!" -- a phrase for which he will forever be known.</li>
                <li><b>1964</b> -- On February 26, Clay joins Nation of Islam, and on March 6, he changes his name to Muhammad Ali.</li>
                <li><b>1966</b> -- Citing his religious beliefs, Ali files for conscientious objector status and refuses to serve in U.S. military, which is involved in the Vietnam War at the time.</li>
                <li><b>1967</b> -- The U.S. government denies his status. Ali is convicted of draft evasion, sentenced to a maximum five years in prison and fined $10,000. The New York boxing association takes back his titles and bans him from boxing for three years.</li>
                <li><b>1970</b> -- The New York State Supreme Court orders his boxing license reinstated.</li>
                <li><b>1971</b> -- In March, Ali fights heavyweight champ Joe Frazier in Madison Square Garden, but loses after 15 rounds, in a unanimous decision.</li>
                <li><b>1974</b> -- In January, Ali beats Frazier. Later that year, he beats George Foreman in the "Rumble in the Jungle," and reclaims world heavyweight champion title.</li>
                <li><b>1975</b> -- Ali again faces Frazier, beats him in fight known as "The Thrilla in Manila."</li>
                <li><b>1978</b> -- In Februrary, Ali loses heavyweight title to Leon Spinks; regains it six months later by beating Spinks.</li>
                <li><b>1981</b> -- Ali loses a unanimous decision to Trevor Berbick. In December, he announces his retirement -- at age 39 -- ending his career with a professional record of 56 wins, 5 losses, 37 knockouts.</li>
                <li><b>1984</b> -- He is diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.</li>
                <li><b>1997</b> -- Sports Illustrated names Ali Sportsman of the Century.</li>
                <li><b>2005</b> -- Ali is awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian honor, by then-President George W. Bush.</li>
